Kola BitMEX Bot
===============

Presentation
------------

KolaBitMEXBot is a program to handle concurrently several pairs of
orders in the BitMEX exchange. A pair is a main order (amoung those
allowed by BitMEX) and an opposite order (again among allowed) that acts
as a stop. Each order enter the book based on conditions you set in
`morders.tsv <https://github.com/maliky/kolaBot/blob/master/kolaBot/morders.tsv>`__.

Main conditions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  time condition: an order activate if the time enters the [dateA,
   dateB] range
-  price condition: an order activate the market enters the [priceA,
   priceB] range

other conditions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  a timeout: an order will cancel after timeout minutes. Note this
   enable speed conditions (eg. activate only if price rise by 60ø in 1
   minute, else cancel and restart)
-  a repeat #: an order will repeat # times if canceled or filled
-  a waitting time: if canceled or filled the order pair will wait
   before repeating (min wait ~1 minute)
-  a hook condition: (new not fully stable yet), an order will activate
   if a hooked order reach a specified status (filled, partialy filled,
   canceled)

Units
~~~~~

-  time units: they are generaly in minutes and for some command line
   params, in seconds.
-  price units can be:

   -  **relative** to market price (index, mark or last Price)

      -  in %, of the activating price (eg. if price move by 5% from
         order activation)
      -  in differential of the activating price (eg if price move by
         -80ø from order activation)

   -  **absolute**, (eg. if price reach 3500ø)

Options specific to the stop order
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By defaut kolaBot runs an opening order (main) and a close order
(secondary or tail or trail). If your main is a buy, the secondary will
be a close and vice-versa. It is possible to run only one of the two
order by setting automatic cancelation condition on the not wanted
order.

Here's a simple example: A buy at market (main order) with a stop at
market (secondary order). You just need to set the price differential
between the main order and the tail order. Like you want a tail at:

-  100ø below the activating price (relative in differential),
-  or at 2% below of the activating price (relative in %),
-  or at 2500ø what ever the activating price (absolute)

Example scenarios
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  you may want to buy 10% of your available balance if the index price
   goes down by 2% in 2 hours but this should only true for the next 24
   hours.

-  you may want to place a simple buy limit if the price goes up by 100
   USD and then automatically set a (trailing) stop at this higher price
   - 20 USD. This trail stop actually acts both as a stop order and a
   trail stop. If the market moves against you, it stays in place but if
   the market move in your favor it will only move once the price will
   be 20 or higher above the entry price (in this example). Also you can
   set in the code some flexibility to the trail. Meaning that if the
   price rise quickly the trail price will close down on the order up to
   20% of the initial 20 USD delta you set. This is because usualy chart
   increase are followed buy sharp reverse and I think it's wise to go
   out of the market to pick it up automatically later.

-  you may want to use a sell (short) each time the price hits 20000 USD
   with a buy at stop 21000 USD and if the stop trigger wait 20 minutes
   before resetting the condition.

All this and more is feasible with this bot. I do not recommend using it
to do trading below 1 order per minute unless you have special API
arrangement with BitMEX and in that case you should have an improved
bot. :o). The reason is that if you have several orders even If I use
the websockets, I make REST call that increase with the number of order
pairs to track.

Hooks: Update <2020-05-05 mar.>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can now use hooks or what was once called chained order in BitMEX. A
hook condition is a condition that is true if the hooked order reach the
state defined in the condition. The states can be Filled (F), Triggered
(T), Canceled (C) or PartiallyFilled (P) Since orders are always passed
in pairs. The hook condition can apply to the Principal order (the one
to enter the book) or the Secondary order (the one to exit). The syntax
to define the hook condition is as follow
\`<name>-[P\|S]\_[F\|C\|T\|P]\`

-  Examples:

   -  src1-P\ :sub:`F`, will hook when the principal order of the pair
      named src1 will be filled
   -  src1-P\ :sub:`C`, will hook when the principal order of the pair
      named src1 will cancel
   -  foo-S\ :sub:`P`, will hook when the principal order of the pair
      named foo will partially fill ...

#. Why hooks ?

   Hooks can be useful especially with trail orders. Hook price and time
   settings are relative to the moment their are started. So you can
   have an order that enter the book when a trailing stop is filled.
   This could be useful to catch reversal in momentum.

Installation
------------

Download or clone the repository
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Git Project URL: https://github.com/maliky/kolaBot

.. code:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/maliky/kolaBot.git
    cd kolaBitMexBot

Install dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This will create a virtualenv and install packages required by the
program. You need to \`pip3\` and \`python3.8\` installed on your
system. *note To install mutliple python on your system, check pyenv\`.*

.. code:: bash

    virtualenv --python=</path/to/python3>  .
    source ./bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt

    # run main programmes
    python -m  kolaBot.run_multi_kola -h
    python -m  kolaBot.multi_kola -h

pip install
~~~~~~~~~~~

If you just want to use kolaBot, you can install the module
directly with \`pip\`

.. code:: bash

    pip install kolaBot

would recommand doing it as a pip editable module with:

.. code:: bash

    # build package with the setup.py
    python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel; twine check dist/*

    # if you used virtualenv wheel and twine will have been installed

    # install the package from local source
    pip install -e . 

Add you API keys in \`kolaBot/kola/secret.py\`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This file it should contain your keys and secrets as for example:

.. code:: example

    LIVE_KEY = "zIKTHISISARANDOMKEYNHII3"
    LIVE_SECRET = "HUMOI9OkK89aIoXDAND THIS IS A SECRET0KAthnauwKj0"
    TEST_KEY = "THEn_XATESTgXOcfKEYbuttz"
    TEST_SECRET = "ANDjmJ3tbACz12VERYnzJS7LONGrPKI3r4uSECRETMU2C4HO"

Write your orders in the `morder.tsv <https://github.com/maliky/kolaBot/blob/master/kolaBot/morders.tsv>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Test your orders on testnet.BitMEX.com
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code:: bash

    python -m kolaBot.run_multi_kola -l INFO > testlog.org

Check the testlog.org file

Satified? Run it live!

Why is it free ?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Because I had fun making it.
#. Also because the gift you may give me having fun using this code,
   will be infinitely more valuable for me, if its free.:o)

That been published, THIS CODE IS LICENCE FREE. No Gnu, no MIT, no

obliged by some legal contracts I'm not consciously aware off because I
did reused codes notably `BitMEX's API
connectors <https://github.com/BitMEX/api-connectors>`__ and an
uncountable number of functions from python's imported libraries
(pandas, request, numpy, datetime...). I hope their authors don't really
care. We are born free, let's stay so. So, your are free to do what you
want with this code BUT... do check it and understand it.
